# 👨🏻‍💻 ijosh.com

This repository contains the contents of [ijosh.com](https://ijosh.com). It is a Hugo-based jamstack site that was migrated over from SquareSpace and now deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

NOTE: Until Cloudflare resolves zone issues that allow automatic HTTPS rewrites and other features, this site will continue to live on [josh.ws](https://josh.ws).

## 🛠 Overview

Whenever changes are pushed to the master branch they will automatically be picked up by Cloudflare and deployed live to the web. As such, development is suggested in any branch other than master before web deployment.


## 👥 Social Icons

This blog post explains how to grab the icons for social and include them as links: [https://www.bigcatcreative.com/blog/social-links-navigation-squarespace](https://www.bigcatcreative.com/blog/social-links-navigation-squarespace).

This website is where the icons are actually sourced from: [https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free)

## 👷🏻‍♂️ Theme Template

The theme is adapted from this theme: [https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-split-theme/](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-split-theme/) and merged with the color scheme and similar from the older Squarespace site. A license has been purchased such that the links to this theme can be removed.
