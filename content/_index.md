I'm a machine learning engineer with a fierce passion for solo travel and fitness.

I spend my time tinkering with software and gadgets, exploring new countries, practicing my lifts, running, yoga, or in a Barry's class. #fitfam

I'm enormously grateful to have spent the last year on sabbatical traveling all over Earth connecting with beautiful humans far and wide.
