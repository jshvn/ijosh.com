I'm an engineer who's all about tech, travel, and fitness—and chasing challenges that make me better, inside and out. Whether it's debugging code, exploring a new country, or crushing a workout, I'm always looking for the next way to level up.

Last year, I hit pause on work to take a solo journey around the world. Sixty countries, countless adventures, and more life lessons than I can count later... I came back with a deeper understanding of people, cultures, and myself. Spoiler: I'm still figuring it out, but the journey's half the fun!

Now I'm diving into my next chapter: building cool things, hitting new personal records at the gym, and finding the next place to explore.

Let's connect! Whether it's tech talk, gym stories, or swapping travel adventures, I'd love to hear from you. Drop me an email or say hi on Instagram!
